    "# Differences of PyCAL86 from CAL (86 or 90 or whatever)\n",
    "\n",
    " - array indices start at 0, not 1.\n",
    " - constrained DOFs must be numbered consecutively, and numbered after the unconstrained ones.  All constrained DOFs are included in the analysis.\n",
    " - the SOLVE command does not support the various modifications to A.  Only S=0 can be specified, and even then, A is not modified.\n",
    " - a PSOLVE command is introduced for solution of partioned systems.  This solution will almost always be needed due to the fact that constrained DOFs are always included in the analysis.\n",
    " - the output of matrices looks a bit different\n",
    " - member directions are numbered 0 through 5, not 1 through 6 (consistent with 0-origin numbering).\n",
    " - only a subset of the commands are implemented.  See the [PyCAL86](PyCAL86-Doc.ipynb) documentation.\n",
    " - added a TTMULT command to form the product T' * K * T\n",
    " - added a TRUSS2D command to return the element stiffness matrix for a 2-D truss element.\n",
    " - made ADDK command work with 4x4 truss EK or 6x6 frame EK."
